# cs328-graph

Studying [Computer Science](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/) at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) was and
continues to be a key part of who I am as a professional software developer. UTCS took whatever skills I had coming in and helped
formalize them into something real. Part of that process was [Dr. Nell Dale's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nell_B._Dale) CS328,
which, at the time, was the second algorithms course. CS328 fell immediately after CS310 ([MC68000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68000))
assembly and before all the upper division computer science courses. Part of CS328 included a brief summary of graph
algorithms, and part of my submission for the graph assignment included a gap that has bothered me ever since I initially
turned it in. You see, I implemented all the graph algorithms except for the [Hamiltonian Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path),
where my submission never quite worked.

This project is a quick implementation of something I really feel like I should've gotten right back in 1994. It's a naive, brute
force implementation of a Hamiltonian cycle (or path) finder, written in C. Nothing fancy algorithmically and no fancy data structures,
but a (very slow) [Thinkpad 11e](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/11e-and-chromebooks/c/thinkpad11e) compiles it in 
seconds and runs it against a 30 node graph essentially instantly. From what I (dimly) remember about the assignment, it should
fairly easily satisfy the requirements given. (Although my current standards for professional work are considerably higher.)

_I'm pretty sure my fourteen year old son thinks I'm crazy for having spent the time on this._ :-)
